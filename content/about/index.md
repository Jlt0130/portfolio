I’m Jonathan Taylor, a data-driven business strategist with a background in psychology and analytics.
I love solving problems at the intersection of data, people, and decision-making.  
Right now, I’m building projects in SQL, Python, and Power BI while exploring how analytics shapes strategy and growth.
