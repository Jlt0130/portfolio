**What I did**
- Cleaned and prepared monthly EIA energy datasets.
- Modeled fossil fuel generation using ARIMA with seasonal differencing.
- Evaluated forecast accuracy through MAPE and residual diagnostics.
- Visualized output trends and scenario forecasts with ggplot2.

**Results**
- Identified long-term decline in fossil fuel usage with projected stagnation ahead.
- Provided policy insight for accelerating renewable transitions.

**Tools Used**
- R, ggplot2, Forecasting, dplyr
