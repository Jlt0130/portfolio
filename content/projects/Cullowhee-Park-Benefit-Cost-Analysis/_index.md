**What I did**
- Estimated recreation value using OLS regression of visitor spending and distance.
- Ran 10,000 Monte Carlo iterations to simulate cost–benefit distributions.
- Calculated NPV, benefit–cost ratio, and internal rate of return.
- Communicated findings to support public policy and grant proposals.

**Results**
- Forecasted expected NPV ≈ $3.95 M with benefit–cost ratio > 1.
- Demonstrated project feasibility under multiple uncertainty scenarios.

**Tools Used**
- Excel, Monte Carlo Simulations, Economic Modeling
