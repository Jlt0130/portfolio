**What I did**
- Cleaned and merged datasets on participant access, classification, and facility usage.
- Visualized hourly traffic trends, class distributions, and top-user insights using Matplotlib.
- Developed dashboards showing facility preferences by undergraduate class.
- Presented findings to the UREC director for data-driven scheduling improvements.

**Results**
- Revealed peak usage times (4–6 PM) and facility preferences by student type.
- Established data foundation for ongoing attendance tracking and dashboard updates.

**Tools Used**
- Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
