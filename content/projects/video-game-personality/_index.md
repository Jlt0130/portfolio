**What I did**
- Completed a full literature review of studies conducted on personality and identity within video games or virtual contexts.
- Designed and executed a 190-participant survey comparing real-life vs. online self-perceptions in gaming contexts
- Applied repeated-measures ANOVAs to assess Big Five personality and body-esteem differences between contexts.

**Results**
- Found statistically significant increases in perceived extraversion and emotional stability online, supporting theories of online identity experimentation.
- Results contribute to understanding how self-perception changes in digital spaces, applicable to UX and consumer behavior analytics.

**Tools**
- SPSS, Qualtrics, Excel
