Welcome to my personal website! My name is **Jonathan Taylor**, and I’m a recent **MBA** and **MS in Applied Data Analytics** graduate from **Appalachian State University**.

With a background that blends **business, analytics, and psychology**, I bring a people-focused approach to understanding data and solving complex business problems. I’m currently developing my skills through hands-on data projects while pursuing a role in the analytics field.

## My Background

My work sits at the intersection of **strategy, analytics, and human behavior**.  
Before grad school, I earned my B.S. in Psychology and explored how personality and perception shape behavior in online settings. Since then, I’ve moved toward the business side of analytics, learning how insights and storytelling can drive better decisions.

Through my graduate assistant role with **App State University Recreation**, I’ve managed teams, optimized scheduling systems, and analyzed operational data to improve efficiency. Those experiences taught me that great data work isn’t just technical, but it’s collaborative and human.

## My Focus

I’m passionate about projects that connect data to real-world outcomes, such as:

- **Workforce analytics** and operations optimization  
- **Data visualization** and storytelling for strategic decisions  
- **Forecasting** and data modeling for planning and policy  
- **Sports and performance analytics**, where data meets motivation  

Right now, I’m expanding my portfolio in SQL, Power BI, and Python, aiming to bring clarity and momentum to organizations ready to grow through data.

## Beyond Work

Outside analytics, you’ll usually find me staying active, talking sports, or diving into creative projects that help people learn and improve. I enjoy leadership, mentorship, and friendship. Seeing others progress is one of the most rewarding parts of any role I’ve held.

## Connect

If any of this resonates, feel free to explore my projects, reach out, or connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jlt0130/).  
I’m always open to collaboration, conversation, or simply swapping ideas about how data can make work, and life, a little smarter.
