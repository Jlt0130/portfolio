**What I did**
- Built SPL queries to detect brute-force patterns and privilege escalation attempts.
- Identified 163 correlated malware and unauthorized access events.
- Visualized daily injection frequency and IP activity over time.
- Produced a written risk summary for system administrators.

**Results**
- Detected two IPs responsible for 500+ injection attempts and 7 GB of data transfer.
- Mapped coordinated attack flow using event correlation queries.

**Tools Used**
- Splunk SPL, Security Log Analysis
