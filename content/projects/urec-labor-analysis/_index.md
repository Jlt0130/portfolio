**What I did**
- Integrated scheduled vs actual hours (SQL joins, rules for early clock-outs and canceled games)
- Built variance views for overall and negative-only discrepancies
- Identified recurring patterns to reduce wasted labor

**Results**
- ~$1K+ potential monthly savings
- Clearer audit trail and scheduling integrity
